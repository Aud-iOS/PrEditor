# PrEditor

PrEditor is a mapping utility devices that allows the user to create custom automaps for Ableton Live's Blue Hand feature with supported controllers

You can create custom maps for all of Ableton Lives Instruments and Effects as well as mappings for VST and AU Plugins and even MaxforLive devices without having to learn a single line of code.

Supported controllers include all of our Customer Remote Scripts available from www.isotonikstudios.com as well as the included files for AKAI APC40 MKI & MKII and the Ableton Push ONE & TWO

This repository is for the sharing of maps made by subscribers of PrEditor
